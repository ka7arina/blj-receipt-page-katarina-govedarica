        <h2 class="ingredient-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <p class="ingredients">2 eggs - ca. 300g flour - ca. 2 T. liquid (can be water, oat milk etc.) - pinch of salt - 3 T. sugar - pack of vanilla sugar</p>
      <div class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Crack two eggs and put them into a bowl. Add 3 Tablespoons of sugar.  Add a small pack of vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt. Add ca. 150ml of your Liquid. </p>
            <p>This could be water, oat milk or anything else. I typically use sparkling water. Make sure to add as much as feels right to you, there is not exact measurement.</p>

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>
                Take a whisk and start whisking. Carefully add as much flour as needed, to remove clumps.</p>
            <p>Whisk the dough until its fluid and doesnt have any clumps anymore and looks light enough.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Prepare your pan by heating it well, then add a tiny bit of Oil and spread it around the pan with a paper roll.</p>
            <p>Make sure to not use too much oil. You dont want the pan to be fully covered in oil, you just want it to have a bit oil
            so the crêpes dont stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>Once the pan is heated and oiled, grab a trowel and take some of the dough, spreading it into the pan. make sure to turn the pan at an angle so the dough gets spread nicely.</p>
            <p>Once the very edges of the dough get baked and arent liquid anymore, slightly loosen them with a spatula to ensure no sticking on the pan. If the bottom side looks ready, flip the crêpe and repeat the process. Once both sides are baked perfectly, grab a plate and place your pancake.</p>
            <p>Repeat this process with the rest of the dough, until you used it all up.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <h2>Finished!</h2>
              <p>And there you go! You now have a few crêpes. Now you can customize and fill them in anyway you want to. You can fill them with Nutella, Lemons and Sugar, Yoghurt, Strawberries and Cream etc.</p>
              <p>I like filling mine either with Nutella or Lemons and Sugar, but this time i tried filling it with Nutella and Bananas and it was really good!</p>
