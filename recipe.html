            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Crack two eggs and put them into a bowl. Add 3 Tablespoons of sugar.  Add a small pack of vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt. Add ca. 150ml of your Liquid. </p>
            <p>This could be water, oat milk or anything else. I typically use sparkling water. Make sure to add as much as feels right to you, there is not exact measurement.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>
                Take a whisk and start whisking. Carefully add as much flour as needed, to remove clumps.</p>
            <p>Whisk the dough until its fluid and doesnt have any clumps anymore and looks light enough.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Prepare your pan by heating it well, then add a tiny bit of Oil and spread it around the pan with a paper roll.</p>
            <p>Make sure to not use too much oil. You dont want the pan to be fully covered in oil, you just want it to have a bit off oil
                so the crêpes dont stick to the bottom of the pan.
